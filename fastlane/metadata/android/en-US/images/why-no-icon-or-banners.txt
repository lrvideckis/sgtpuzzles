The app icon and banner images are not included in this repository to avoid placing them under the
MIT Licence (see /LICENCE). This is entirely because people have occasionally uploaded clones of
this application to Google Play, adding only ads and nothing of any value for users. The MIT
Licence, chosen to match upstream, does not prevent that, but excluding the promotional graphics
from that licence helps in two ways:

(1) Any clones that don't include them are easily distinguished from this original ad-free version,
such that users can more easily choose between versions on their merits rather than being tricked.

(2) Any clones that do include them would be in breach of copyright and can be reported to Google.
